### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##### I'm Victoria Gonzalez.
###### I'm currently learning Full Stack Development at 4Geeks Academy.

ðŸ’¬ A little bit about me: I'm a nature lover. In my free time you can find me hiking to the top of a mountain, at the beach, doing Yoga outdoors, or traveling to a new destination. I love art and design and studied Sustainable Architecture and Sustainable Fashion Design. 
I started my professional career as an English teacher and worked for different academies in Language Immersion programs. Later on I moved on to Software sales and that's how my interest in programming and technology started.

I would love to be a part of projects that make a difference ðŸ˜Š

ðŸ“« You can find me on [LinkedIn]
